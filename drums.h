// sample-based, and the DJ filter.
//
// Ported from NIBBLE's DRUMS half (../WoskshopButtons/drums.h), whose synth
// engine is hardware-tested and taken as-is: a phase accumulator masked to 18
// bits, a triangle folded out of it, the pitch swept downward while the
// envelope runs, and exponential decay via `e -= (e >> shift) + 1`. See that
// file's header comment for the full derivation (from
// 74_Wild_Pebble/WildPebble.cpp:787-901) and docs/LESSONS.md §2 for the bugs
// that arithmetic has already caused once (the `+1`-caps-your-range trap, the
// phase-accumulator-width mismatch) so they are not repeated here.
//
// NIBBLE-KO's difference: every voice can ALSO play a sample instead of the
// synth voice, chosen per-slot by the user via the WebUI — see WorkshopBio's
// webui.cpp/samplestore.h for the upload/flash-management pattern this will
// extend (../WorkshopBio/samplestore.h has the resolve-by-priority logic:
// user upload overrides baked default, per slot).
//
// TODO(design session): the PCM playback path is NOT implemented yet. This
// header currently ports only the synth backend, unchanged in behaviour from
// NIBBLE. Still to design, before writing it:
//   - DrumVoice PCM state (position/fraction/increment — see BioMimicry's
//     Voice::pcm/pcmLen/pcmIdx/pcmFrac/pcmInc in ../WorkshopBio/voices.h, and
//     its comment on why position must split whole-samples from a Q16
//     fraction rather than being one Q16 number for samples over ~1.3s)
//   - a per-voice backend flag (kSynth / kSample) and how DrumKit::Step()
//     dispatches on it
//   - what the Y knob does to a sample voice — NIBBLE deliberately chose
//     synthesis partly BECAUSE Y-as-resampling is a harder problem than
//     Y-as-live-parameter (see docs/LESSONS.md §4, "Decisions worth
//     reconsidering, not inheriting")
//   - the WebUI protocol extension for per-voice source assignment, on top of
//     BioMimicry's upload/erase/slot messages
//   - flash layout for 12 user-replaceable slots (BioMimicry's
//     samplestore.h/UserSampleHeader is per mode*variant; this card has no
//     modes, just 12 flat voice slots)

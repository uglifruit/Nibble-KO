// fx.h — the twelve performance effects of FX bank 1.
//
// Reached by holding any SINGLE and tapping another: four shifts times three
// taps is twelve ordered gestures, exactly as DRUMS gets its twelve voices
// from the same four buttons (see levels.h's Shift()). Effects are MOMENTARY:
// active while the tap is held, gone the instant it is released.
//
// Two families, and they hook into completely different places:
//
//   AUDIO effects process the drum bus, one sample at a time. They live in
//   FxRack::Process(), called from the audio tick.
//
//   TIMING effects change WHEN the loop's hits fire, or add extra ones. They
//   cannot be done in the audio path at all — they act on the looper's output
//   before a voice is even triggered. See FxRack::TimingMode().
//
// Nothing here touches the recorded pattern. An effect is a filter on the way
// out, so releasing the button leaves the loop exactly as it was — which is
// what makes it safe to lean on one mid-performance.

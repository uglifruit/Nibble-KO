// The kit
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Combo order is A B C D AB AC AD BC BD CD. Kick and snare are on A and B so
// the two sounds a pattern is mostly made of need one finger each; the toms sit
// on pairs sharing a finger, so hold-A-and-tap gives a tom run.
//
// This table is the SYNTH character of each slot. Whether a slot actually
// renders from it or from a recording is decided elsewhere, by
// gVoiceSample[] in samplestore.h — an index into the sample bank, or -1 to
// stay synthesised. TriggerVoice resolves that per hit through
// ResolveSample(), so a slot that plays a sample simply never reaches the
// synth path and its entry here goes unused.

/// The kit as a flat list of VOICES, which is what the looper records.
///
/// A recorded event stores "kick", not "C held while D was tapped". That is the
/// right level of abstraction: how a hit was produced is a property of the
/// performance, not of the pattern, and storing the gesture meant a replayed
/// loop had to re-derive a sound from a combination that no longer had a shift
/// attached to it. It also means a future edit to the mapping does not silently
/// change what an existing loop plays.
///
/// Index order is the display order. LEVELS are set by PERCEIVED loudness, not
/// by energy or by peak.
///
/// Two corrections were needed, and both came from voices being reported as too
/// loud despite the numbers looking balanced:
///
///  1. Equal ENERGY is not equal loudness once pitches differ. The ear is about
///     24dB more sensitive at 800Hz than at 55Hz, so the cowbell — a pure tone
///     sitting right in that band — was the loudest thing in the kit while
///     measuring the same as the kick. It is now 1500Hz (a real cowbell's
///     register) at 40/256.
///  2. A long voice needs to be quieter still, because the ear integrates. The
///     crash is the extreme case: 22/256 AND a shorter decay, since level alone
///     could not fix it without making the transient inaudible.
///
/// Rough rule for editing this table: a voice an octave higher wants roughly
/// half the level; a voice twice as long wants roughly two thirds.
///
/// Pitches are written as HzToInc(...) so the table can be READ as frequencies
/// and checked against what a drum should be. See docs/LESSONS.md §2 for what
/// happens when a bare increment is used instead.

// webui.h — USB-MIDI/SysEx sample upload for NIBBLE-KO.
//
// The card enumerates as a USB-MIDI device; a browser talks to it over
// WebMIDI SysEx to assign each of the 12 voice slots a synth voice or an
// uploaded sample. Drop a WAV in the browser, it arrives as 8-bit mono 48kHz
// and is written into the user flash region — no toolchain, no reflash.
//
// SysEx payloads must be 7-bit (every byte 0-127), so audio is 7-bit encoded:
// 7 source bytes become 8 septets, the 8th carrying the high bits. Same
// scheme WorkshopBio and WorkshopZX use.
//
// Adapted from WorkshopBio/webui.h. The message set is close to identical —
// upload/erase/slot-query are the same shape — with the mode+variant slot
// addressing collapsed to a single voice index (0..kNumVoices-1), and a new
// MSG_SET_SOURCE for choosing synth vs. sample per slot.
//
// Both things this header once waited on are settled:
//   1. PCM playback exists and is hardware-tested — TriggerVoice resolves
//      each hit through ResolveSample(), so an upload has somewhere to land.
//   2. MSG_SET_SOURCE's payload is [voice, bank], one byte each, with
//      kSourceSynth (0x7F) meaning "synthesise this slot". It writes
//      gVoiceSample[] in samplestore.h.
//
// IMPORTANT: writing flash while ComputerCard runs
// WILL HANG THE CARD unless all five steps in docs/LESSONS.md §"If you let
// users upload samples" are followed — raise-and-wait for core 0 to park,
// disable DMA_IRQ_0 + PWM_IRQ_WRAP + USBCTRL_IRQ, prime the boot2 RAM copy,
// wrap writes in __not_in_flash_func, and buffer the whole upload in RAM
// first. WorkshopBio/webui.cpp is the worked reference for all five.
